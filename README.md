# NYC-Taxi-Fare Predictor ðŸš•ðŸ’°
Predicting NYC taxi fares using machine learning! This project analyzes historical trip data to build a model that estimates fares based on trip details. Perfect for drivers, Companies, passengers, and city planners.

### Quick Overview
We built a model to predict how much a taxi ride in NYC will cost. We looked at things like:
*   Where you're going: Pickup & dropoff locations (distance is key!).
*   When you're traveling: Time of day, day of the week, and even the time of year.

### Key Insights (Spoiler Alert!)
*   Weekends and Rush Hour = Higher Fares: Demand (and fares) surge on weekends and during commute times.
*   Summer is Busiest: More people take taxis in the summer months.
*   Distance Matters (Obviously): Longer trips cost more, but time also plays a big role.
*   Our Model is Pretty Good i.e. Random Forest model accurately predicts fares.

### How I Did It?
1.  Cleaned the Data: Removed bad data to make our model smarter.
2.  Built New Features: Created helpful info like trip distance and time-based features.
3.  Trained Machine Learning Models: Tested Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
4.  Picked the Best Model: Random Forest was the winner!

### Tech Used
*   Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
